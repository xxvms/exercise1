Exercise 1
----------

The file `exercise1.hpp` contains declarations of various functions.
Your task is to implement these functions in `exercise1.cpp` so that they
meet the requirements stated in the comments.

Each function has a set of test cases. You can select which tests to
run using the target select drop-down on the CLion menu bar.

Have fun!
